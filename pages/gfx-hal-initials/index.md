# `gfx-hal` & `vulkan` basics

I have found that learning new things every often,
leads to chaos, and people (specifically ME) tend to forget many things they have already
learnt before.

<br />

These notes will help me to keep reference notes for myself, as well as for anybody who is willing to
learn Vulkan API using `gfx-hal`.

<br />

Learning `rust` language and `vulkan` APIs, both are very difficult for starters. I am still struggling
to understand the basics, let aside writing proper Memory Management and Performance optimized Rust
Code. Reading these notes requires prior knowledge of at-least one statically typed language (like
`java`, `C` etc.), and some understanding of graphics, though even I am very new to Graphics Programming,
so even for me many concepts are very new, and I will try to either explain them as much as I could, or
better point you to some reference to take a look into and understand it better.

<br />

__Special Thanks to__:

* [@lokathor](https://github.com/Lokathor), for writing an open book on learning basics of using `gfx-hal`,
  though with very old `gfx-hal` version, but it still guided me a lot. You can read it
  [here](https://rust-tutorials.github.io/learn-gfx-hal/).
* [@mistodon](https://twitter.com/mistodon), for writing such a good blog on `gfx-hal` and `vulkan`, which
  you can read [here](https://www.falseidolfactory.com/2020/04/01/intro-to-gfx-hal-part-1-drawing-a-triangle.html).
