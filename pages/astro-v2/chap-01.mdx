## What are we Building

We will be building a Nostalgic Astro Blaster Game from 90s.
The purpose of this post is to keep an archive for myself (and
others), who are very beginners in game programming and does'nt
know some basic concepts used in game dev.

> **TLDR;** You can find the code here: [rustschool](https://github.com/Shub1427/rustschool/tree/master/gui/ggez_basics/src/bin/astro_blaster_v2)

## Draw Black Background on Screen

```rs
use ggez::event;
use ggez::graphics;
use ggez::{Context, ContextBuilder, GameResult};

struct World {
    stage: usize, // Nothing else for now.
}

impl World {
    fn new() -> Self {
        World {
            stage: 0
        }
    }
}

impl event::EventHandler for World {
    fn update(&mut self, _ctx: &mut Context) -> GameResult {
        Ok(())
    }

    fn draw(&mut self, ctx: &mut Context) -> GameResult {
        graphics::clear(ctx, graphics::BLACK); // Clear with Black Background
        graphics::present(ctx)?; // It's important to present the buffer on Screen
        Ok(())
    }
}

fn main() -> GameResult {
    let (ctx, event_loop) = &mut ContextBuilder::new("Astro Blaster v2", "Subroto Biswas")
        .build()?;
    let mut state = World::new();
    event::run(ctx, event_loop, &mut state)
}
```
