Personal Portfolio Page

Represents my works in an Interactive way. The way I am trying to represent my
work, is using a Gamification UI, where I will create each level of my life,
as a seperate Level Of Game. Each Level represents my stages of life, the things
that I learnt and made. Each level has a Name which signifies my part of Life.

As I am a Fan of Naruto Series, I wanted to create an Interactive Site, that links my
life to that of Naruto's. Hope You will like the way I represent my work.

## Local Setup:

Project is built using Angular Framework, v4.4.4.
I am trying to build everything from scratch, thus am not using any dependency for now.

Any other dependency (if present), will be mentioned in the Dependency Section...

### Requirements

* `npm install` to download all dependencies
* `npm run local` to start the Webpack-Dev-Server, on port 9998, [link](http://localhost:9998).
* `npm run deploy`, for an AOT based deployment, or use `npm run deploy:dev`, without AOT.

### Dependencies

* Using [Normalize CSS](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), for removing CSS inconsistencies
  on different browsers...
