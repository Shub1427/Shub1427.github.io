# Shub1427.github.io

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Personal Portfolio Page

* My Idea: (As this is difficult for me right now, I will just make a Simple Responsive UI, that doesn't use many Images, Will work with simple Shapes to build and Awesome UI)
* My Actual Idea: (Will work on this Later when I am relaxed...)
  - Represents my works in an Interactive way. The way I am trying to represent my
  work, is using a Gamification UI, where I will create each level of my life,
  as a seperate Level Of Game. Each Level represents my stages of life, the things
  that I learnt and made. Each level has a Name which signifies my part of Life.

  > __NOTE:__ As I am a Fan of Naruto Series, I wanted to create an Interactive Site, 
  > that links my life to that of Naruto's. Hope You will like the way I represent my work.

## Local Setup:

Project is built using [Creat React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
I am trying to build everything from scratch, thus am not using any dependency for now.

Any other dependency (if present), will be mentioned in the Dependency Section...

HMR is enabled (with a workaround), but it affects the whole App State, Issue Still exists [93](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/93) and [897](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/897)...

__Deployment on Github Pages:__
Checkout [Deploy Create-React-App Projects](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/surge-vs-github-pages-deploying-a-create-react-app-project-c0ecbf317089)


### Requirements

* `npm install` to download all dependencies
* `npm run local` to start the Webpack-Dev-Server, on port 9998, [link](http://localhost:9998).
* `npm run deploy`, for an AOT based deployment, or use `npm run deploy:dev`, without AOT.

### Dependencies

* Using [Normalize CSS](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), for removing CSS inconsistencies
  on different browsers... _(Not Yet Included...)_
* Using Sass for Css Preprocessing... Just for Fun, as React can even Work great without it...

### TODOs:

* Add Analytics
* SEO
